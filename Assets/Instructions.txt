At the beginning of the game a character, weapon and room will be chosen
at random to be the murderer, murder weapon and location of murder respectively.

The rest of the cards will be shuffled and dealt to the players.

On your turn you will roll the dice and be given the option to move.

If you are in a room on your turn you may suggest or accuse a suspect 
and weapon of your choice of murder in the room you are in.

After a suggestion players clockwise from you will attempt to prove your 
suggestion wrong by showing you a card from your suggestion.
(If a player has a card that means it wasn't chosen at the start)

If you accuse a suspect and are correct, you win. Otherwise you lose and
can no longer take turns of your own, but still prove other players wrong
if you can, when they make suggestions.
